Hello, my name is Pedro Rodrigues, a somewhat fresh graduate in physical engineering from Aveiro University. I am a humble machine learning afficionado, however you might not be finding that here for a very long while. 

I mostly have been working locally for most of my life and I never really finish my projects unfortunately or leave them in a state I would like to share with people. This needs to change so you might be suprised soon. I only have my Thesis and other presentations I did in Latex to show.

I mostly develop in python, and most deep learning I do is in pytorch and scikit-learn. 

Thank you for visiting. Please peer into everything freely.
