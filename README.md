Hello, My name is Pedro. I am a freshly graduated student of Physical Engineering from Aveiro University. I am a machine learning afficionado.

This is my very incomplete github for now, I only have my Thesis and other presentations I did in Latex to show. You might be wondering where is the machine learning then, and in particular Python code etc.. Well it's being formated and they'll be public eventually. 

Thank you for visiting. Please peer into everything freely.
