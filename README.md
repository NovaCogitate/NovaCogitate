Hello, my name is Pedro Rodrigues, a somewhat fresh graduate in physical engineering from Aveiro University. I am a humble machine learning afficionado. I just recently invested into a large system for machine learning. And you should start seeing some of my personal wacky projects here. 

In addition to machine learning I also have laying around a lot of work for my thesis and previous projects. I mostly develop in python, and most deep learning I do is in pytorch and scikit-learn. 

Thank you for visiting. Please peer into everything freely.
