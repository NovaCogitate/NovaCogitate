Hello, I am Pedro Rodrigues. I hold a master's degree in physical engineering from Aveiro University in sunny old Portugal, where I was born and raised. 

I currently work as a machine learning researcher at the DKFZ, focusing mainly on generative AI through diffusion probabilistic models.  

I am a machine learning aficionado who is missing physics in his life, probably some sort of Stockholm syndrome; soon, I will have another publication focused on generative AI, and with that, my personal goal set around May 2022 would have been done.  

When I was employed as a data scientist, I focused on NLP for market insights with large partners. 

When I studied at Aveiro, I became a published author in particle physics.

Sadly, I do not have much in my Github;
