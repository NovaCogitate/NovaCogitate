Hello, my name is Pedro Rodrigues, a graduate of physical engineering from Aveiro University in Sunny old Portugal. I am a humble machine learning afficionado. I just recently invested into a large system for machine learning. And you should start seeing some of my personal wacky projects here (These will stay private for a while). 

In addition to machine learning I also have laying around a lot of work for my thesis and previous projects. I mostly develop in python, and most deep learning I do is in pytorch and scikit-learn. I focus on computer vision for my work with the DKFZ. 

Thank you for visiting. Please peer into everything freely.
